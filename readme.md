# Welcome to *Geochemistry*


This is an early draft of **An Introduction to Geochemistry** textbook to be used by Geology and Environmental Geosciences majors for ***GEOL 250: Introduction to Geochemistry*** class at the College of Charleston.  One semester of chemistry (CHEM 111 or equivalent) is a required prerequisite for this course.  

The first chapter summarizes atomic principles, including the periodic table and chemical reactions.  Subsequent two chapters focus on thermodynamics and chemical equilibrium principles that are foundational to environmental geosciences. These fundamental geochemical concepts are applied in our understanding of geological and environmental processes.  The rest of the textbook introduces, topics such acids and bases, redox processes, chemical kinetics, environmental isotopes, and environmental organic chemistry. Students are strongly advised to use this textbook and all suggested readings for more in-depth coverage.

I incorporated several examples and practice exercises throughout the textbook. I have also incorporated short case studies and links to topic-related videos that were created by many content creators. I will continue to add and improve these exercises to help you understand and apply the concepts better.
